# foxsoccer.tv minify script for Firefox + Greasemonkey
This is a little script to minify the foxsoccer.tv UI. Add it to Greasemonkey with the url http://www.foxsoccer.tv/watchdvr/*

It hides all of the UI and links on the Flash player page, so getting back to the listing is manual (for now).

For a super minimal experience, put the page in its own window and hide all of the Firefox toolbars from View -> Toolbars.

Enjoy
